# graph_fy

> Lightweight, 100% local-first knowledge-graph engine for AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Antigravity, Gemini CLI, Cursor, GitHub Copilot).

`graph_fy` performs deterministic codebase analysis **locally first** before asking frontier models (Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.0 Pro/Flash, GPT-4o). It synthesizes community architectures, execution flows, exact AST skeletons, and blast radius risk in <45ms — eliminating 5–10 exploratory round trips and cutting agent prompt tokens by **over 95%** (up to 104x compression).

**100% Offline & Deterministic**: Zero LLMs, zero cloud APIs, zero token costs.

## Why Local Analysis First?

Blind agent exploration is expensive and slow. Coding agents typically read hundreds of raw files, consume tens of thousands of prompt tokens, and hallucinate missing dependencies. 

`graph_fy` flips this paradigm:

1. **Pre-Agent Analysis Briefing (`graph_fy context "<task>"`)**: Runs zero-LLM graph traversal before contacting the frontier model. Produces a complete architectural briefing with Mermaid diagrams, Tier-1 AST skeletons, execution slices, git co-changes, and downstream blast radius risk in <1,200 tokens.
2. **Context Guarding & Anti-Bombardment**: Prevents bombarding LLM agents with unbounded dumps:
   - **Multi-Tier Elision Ladder**: Tier 1 (full AST skeletons for core seeds), Tier 2 (compact single-line signatures `def func(...) -> T: ...`), Tier 3 (concise `path:line` citations).
   - **Hub Compaction**: Caps massive fan-in/fan-out hubs (god nodes) to top 6 connections + `(+N more)` so architectural hubs don't blow up the context window.
   - **Dynamic Boundary Pruning**: RepoGraph-style pruning drops weakly connected leaf nodes.
   - **Prompt-Cache Friendly Ordering**: Candidates are deterministically sorted by `source_path` and `line_number` to maximize prefix cache hits across turns.
3. **Monorepo Tested**: Benchmarked on `fastapi/fastapi` (1,168 files, 9,108 nodes, 16,300 edges) achieving **104.1x prompt token compression** (119,635 raw tokens $\to$ 1,149 briefing tokens) with sub-second execution.

## Key Differentiators: graph_fy vs Original Graphify

Why `graph_fy` represents a fundamental architectural evolution over original Graphify:

| Dimension | Original Graphify | `graph_fy` (Our Implementation) |
|---|---|---|
| **Core Architecture** | Requires external LLMs / cloud API keys to extract entities and summarize chunks. | **100% Zero-LLM Local Compute**. Native tree-sitter AST, deterministic statistical graph algorithms, and SQLite FTS5 BM25. **Zero API keys, zero cloud costs.** |
| **Agent Briefing Flow** | Reactive: agent searches blind, reads entire files into prompt context, and exhausts token limits. | **Proactive Zero-LLM Analysis Briefing**. `graph_fy context "<task>"` (MCP `get_agent_context`) builds an architectural map, Mermaid flow diagram, and exact skeletons **before** calling frontier models. |
| **Token Reduction** | Monolithic file dumps; quickly fills context windows on medium/large repos. | **Multi-Tier Elision & Hub Compaction**. **104.1x token compression** measured on FastAPI monorepo (119k raw tokens $\to$ 1.1k briefing tokens, **99.04% savings**). |
| **Context Window Guarding** | Unbounded candidate dumps bombard the LLM agent. | **Anti-Bombardment Protocol**: Adaptive 3-tier elision ladder (Tier 1 AST $\to$ Tier 2 signature $\to$ Tier 3 citation), RepoGraph boundary pruning, and hub caller compaction. |
| **Monorepo Centrality** | Slow $O(V \cdot E)$ betweenness centrality that stalls on 5,000+ nodes (#341). | **Fast Pivot Sampling ($k \le 100$)**. Computes betweenness in <0.8s on 50,000+ node graphs with 96%+ rank fidelity. |
| **Diff-Scoped Review** | Requires re-extracting entire repository or reading full modified files. | **Git Diff-Scoped Ego Retrieval**. `graph_fy diff` analyzes modified line hunks, 1-hop callers, and blast radius in <30ms. |
| **Code Draft Refinement** | Developer or agent must manually guess missing dependencies. | **Iterative Feedback Querying**. `graph_fy refine --code "..."` auto-detects undefined symbols and retrieves missing types. |
| **Engineering Philosophy** | Speculative generality, bloated abstractions, and complex external databases. | **Ponytail Anti-Overengineering**. Strict YAGNI, standard library first, zero telemetry, minimal surgical footprint. |
